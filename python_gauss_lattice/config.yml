# This is an input file for the diagonalization routine. The format is YAML,
# which is quite flexible.
# The values don't have to be in any specific order. It is important though,
# that the names stay as they are - these are the variable names, essentially,
# in the code.

# ----------------------------------
# General parameters:
working_directory: output/ # Directory where everything is stored/loaded.
L : [2,2,2] # Spatial extent of the lattice.
logfile : 'logfile.log' # Logfile to store the output.

# ----------------------------------
# Important for diagonalization.
gauge_particles : 'bosons' # Either bosons or fermions.
full_diag : False # If True, the full matrix is diagonalized - extremely costly.
ev_type : 'SA' # ARPACK style specification of the types of eigenvalues. Most likely you want to use 'SA' which gives the lowest algebraic values.
n_eigenvalues : 30 # Number of eigenvalues to compute.
lambda: -5 # lambda Coupling.
J : -1 # J Coupling.
winding_sector : [0,0,0] # If this is specified, only the appropriate winding sector will be diagonalized.
compute_eigenstates: True # If true, the eigenstates will be exported.
store_hamiltonian: True # If true, the Hamiltonian will be stored.

# ----------------------------------
# Important for multi-lambda diagonalization. (overrides lambda parameter)
lambdas : [-3, 1, 201] # Range that specifies the lambda values to scan (min, max, n_steps)
