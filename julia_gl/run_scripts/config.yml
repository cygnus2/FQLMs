# This is an input file for the diagonalization routine. The format is YAML,
# which is quite flexible.
# The values don't have to be in any specific order. It is important though,
# that the names stay as they are - these are the variable names, essentially,
# in the code.

# ----------------------------------
# General parameters:
# working_directory: /home/lukas/_temp_FQLM/
working_directory: '/home/lukas/_TEMP_fqlm/'
logfile : 'logfile.log' # Logfile to store the output.
overwrite: true
store_hamiltonian: true # If true, the Hamiltonian will be stored.

gauge_particles : 'bosons' # Either bosons or fermions.
L: [2,2,4] # Spatial extent of the lattice.
winding_sector: [0,0,0] # Winding sector to be considered.
J : 1.0 # J Coupling.

lambda_range : [-3.0, 1.0, 61] # Range that specifies the lambda values to scan (min, max, n_steps)
# lambda_list: [-2.0, 0.0]
# lambda: -2.0
observables: ["parity", "unity"]

# ----------------------------------
# Important for diagonalization.
full_diag : False # If True, the full matrix is diagonalized - extremely costly.
n_eigenvalues : 25 # Number of eigenvalues to compute.
n_eigenstates: 5 # If true, the eigenstates will be exported.

ev_type : 'SA' # ARPACK style specification of the types of eigenvalues. Most likely you want to use 'SA' which gives the lowest algebraic values under consideration of the sign, i.e., the lowest part of the spectrum.
# max_iter: 1000 # Maximal number of iterations for ARPACK. Should not be touched, but provides a handle just in case.
#tol: 1e-15 # Numerical tolerance for ARPACK. Defaults to machine precision, but this could lead to problems sometimes.

# LE stuff.
